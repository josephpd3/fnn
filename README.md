# fnn - Ferrous Neural Networks
--------
### Simple Neural Networks in Rust!
--------

Hey there! This project is currently in an extremely alpha stage, and only supports the most rudimentary nerual networks -- due to it being my senior capstone project which I haven't been able to dedicate time to since finding work after graduation.

Ideally, I'll be able to add more features and clear documentation sometime in the future as Rust's linear algebra packages mature and I have the time.

Until such a time, feel free to dig in as it is now!
