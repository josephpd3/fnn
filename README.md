# fnn - Ferrous Neural Networks
--------
### Simple Neural Networks in Rust!
--------

Hey interested person! Currently, I am doing this project as my capstone senior computer science project in university.
Unfortunately, this means that completion of any and all milestones is controlled chaos amidst my other classwork.

Ideally, I'll have some more sane structure to this project by the summer, along with some better documentation to get anyone interested started in digging in to my code. Rust has some excellent static documentation generated through Cargo, but I have yet to fully take advantage of that.

Until such a time, feel free to dig in as it is now! There are a few redundant or incomplete abstractions, and I currently use a self-written matrix struct that is just completely unoptimized and does not even touch the GPU. I will also be writing up milestones and issues as the summer rolls through to delineate an ideal path of progress to this being a feasible tool for use.
